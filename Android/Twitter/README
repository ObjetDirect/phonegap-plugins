# Twitter plugin for Phonegap #

This is inspired from the excellent iOS' plugin: https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iPhone/Twitter

For the moment, only two (major) functions are binding:
1. isTwitterAvailable
2. composeTweet

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

Using this plugin requires [Android PhoneGap](http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-android).

1. To install the plugin, move www/twitter.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html file after phonegap.js.

    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="phonegap.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="twitter.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

2. Create a directory within your project called "src/com/phonegap/plugins/twitter" and move Twitter.java into it.

3. In your res/xml/plugins.xml file add the following line:

    &lt;plugin name="Twitter" value="com.phonegap.plugins.twitter.Twitter"/&gt;

## Using the plugin ##

The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.twitter`.  To use, call one of the following, available methods:

<pre>
  /**
	* Check if Twitter is installed
    *
    */
  isTwitterAvailable(success, failure)
</pre>

Sample use:

     window.plugins.twitter.isTwitterAvailable(
		function(bool){ 
			if(bool){
				// Do something
				
			} else {
				alert("Twitter is not available");
			}
		},
		function(){
			alert("We have a problem with the plugin");
		}
	);

<pre>
  /**
	* Compose tweet and open the Twitter application
    */
  composeTweet(success, failure, message) {
</pre>

Sample use:

     window.plugins.twitter.composeTweet(
		 function(){
		 },
		 function(){
			alert("We have a problem with the plugin");
		 },
		 "Base of the tweet"
	);
